Timberwolf's UK Trains (Community Addon)
========================================

An addon for Timberwolf's UK Trains featuring
additional trains and wagons as requested by the
OpenTTD community.

Requires Timberwolf's Trains to be installed and
active.

Preservation Railways
---------------------

Preservation railways are a new feature for the Community
Addon. In order to build a preservation railway, attach
a carriage marked as having the "Preserve railway bonus"
to an old locomotive.

As locomotives get older, passengers will enjoy longer
trips before the amount they pay for their journey reduces;
people in the OpenTTD world are more interested in travelling
behind a 100 year old locomotive than a 30-40 year old one.
A longer preserved line with smaller and cheaper locomotives
over a century old can be very profitable!

Note that elderly mainline locomotives will be very expensive
to run, even at the restricted speeds of a preservation
railway. Long-lived narrow gauge locomotives may be an easier
option, emulating the very first preserved railways.

Narrow Gauge
------------

The Community Addon features a new type of railway:
narrow gauge. This will show up if you have a railtype set
that includes the NGRL track type - as ever, Timberwolf's
Tracks is recommended.

Narrow gauge trains are smaller, slower and have lower
capacities than their mainline counterparts. However they
are also cheaper to buy and run, and exceptionally long
lived. This makes them a good option for starting the
game when funds are limited, or for servicing industries
with low output.

Due to their long life, narrow gauge locomotives are an
excellent option for running preserved railways.

My thanks to all the people on the OpenTTD forums, 
IRC channel and Discord who offered suggestions, 
help and advice while I was creating the set, and
also to my YouTube subscribers and commenters for
encouraging me to post development videos.
